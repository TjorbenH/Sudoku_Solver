# Sudoku_Solver
Hi people
This is one of my first "bigger" projects. It uses a backtracking Algorithem to solve a sudoku (two-dimentional list) 
Hope you like it.

UPDATE: 
I've uploaded a newer and better version. It is not object-orientated anymore but it now uses recurcive backtracking and is thus MUCH more efficient. I've included a little stopwatch so you can see what I mean.
