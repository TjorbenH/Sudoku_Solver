# Sudoku_Solver
Hi people
This is one of my first projects. It uses a recurcive backtracking algorithem to solve a sudoku (two-dimentional list) 
Hope you like it.

UPDATE: 
I've uploaded a newer and better version. It isn't recurcive anymore but it is object-orientated and is thus MUCH more efficient. I've included a little stopwatch so you can see what I mean.
